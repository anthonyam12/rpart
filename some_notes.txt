Rpart:
	- sorts -- sort of the continous variables smallest to largest 
		- sorts[var_num][i] - gives the variable at the ith location in var_num column.
			- e.g. TEST_COL
					1
					10
					4
					15
				sorts[0][1] (0 = 0th column == TEST_COL) will give the index in the xdata[0] array
				that corresponds to the value if sorted, in this case sorts[0][1] = 3 = xdata[0][3] = 4
				(the second spot in the sort array corresponds to the 4th index in the xdata matrix = value 4)
